Project README - alx-low_level_programming (4th August 2023)
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of argc and argv, as well as basic operations like printing, copying, and calculating.

Author: John Sagwe

Task 0: It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to
File: 0-whatsmyname.c

This program prints its name, followed by a new line. If the program is renamed, it will print the new name without having to compile it again. The path before the name of the program is not removed.

Task 1: Silence is argument carried out by other means
File: 1-args.c

This program prints the number of arguments passed into it. It prints the count of arguments, followed by a new line.

Task 2: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
File: 2-args.c

This program prints all the arguments it receives, including the first one. Each argument is printed on a separate line.

Task 3: Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
File: 3-mul.c

This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result, followed by a new line. If the program does not receive exactly two arguments, it prints "Error" and returns 1.

Task 4: To infinity and beyond
File: 4-add.c

This program adds positive numbers and prints the result, followed by a new line. If no number is passed, it prints 0. If any of the numbers contain non-digit symbols, it prints "Error" and returns 1.

Task 5: Minimal Number of Coins for Change (Advanced)
File: 100-change.c

This advanced program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount of money (in cents). It takes the amount as an argument and prints the minimum number of coins needed to make that change. If the amount is negative, it prints 0. If the number of arguments passed is not exactly 1, it prints "Error" and returns 1.
