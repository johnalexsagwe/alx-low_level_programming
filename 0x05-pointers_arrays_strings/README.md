# ALX Low Level Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains C programs demonstrating various concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Task 0: 98 Battery st.

Function `reset_to_98` updates the value of an integer pointer to 98.

## Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Function `swap_int` swaps the values of two integers.

## Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Function `_strlen` returns the length of a string.

## Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Function `_puts` prints a string followed by a new line.

## Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear

Function `print_rev` prints a string in reverse followed by a new line.

## Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

Function `rev_string` reverses a string.

## Task 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true

Function `puts2` prints every other character of a string.

## Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Function `puts_half` prints the second half of a string.

## Task 8: Arrays are not pointers

Function `print_array` prints n elements of an integer array.

## Task 9: strcpy

Function `_strcpy` copies a string from src to dest.

## Task 10: Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers

Function `_atoi` converts a string to an integer.

## Task 11: Don't hate the hacker, hate the code

Program `101-keygen.c` generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.
